# Prompts Used During Development

## Initial Architecture
1. "What's the best way to structure a Next.js 14 app with Supabase for storing URL snapshots and diffs?"
2. "How do I use the `diff` npm package to compare two strings line by line in TypeScript?"
3. "How do I use cheerio to extract readable text from HTML, stripping scripts and styles?"

## Feature Implementation
4. "How do I keep only the last 5 rows per group in Supabase using the JS client?"
5. "How do I use AbortSignal.timeout() in a Node.js fetch call to set a request timeout?"
6. "What's the correct way to call the OpenAI chat completions API directly with fetch instead of the SDK?"

## Debugging
7. "My PostCSS config throws: 'tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin' — what changed in Tailwind v4?"
8. "My Next.js API route returns 400 'URL is required' but the textarea has a value — what could cause this?"
9. "The analyze route is returning 500 silently — how do I log the full OpenAI response to debug?"
10. "Supabase insert is succeeding but select after insert returns null — why?"

## Review & Polish
11. "Review this API route for edge cases.
12. "What are common mistakes when storing large text content in Supabase text columns?"
